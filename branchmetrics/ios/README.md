carthage update
```

### to use this pod configure your `robovm.xml`

```
<config>
    ...
    <frameworkPaths>
        <path>libs</path>  <!-- path where Branch.framework is located -->
    </frameworkPaths>
</config>
```

### Gradle

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```
dependencies {
   ... other dependencies ...
